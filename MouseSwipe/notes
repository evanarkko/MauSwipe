WALL ISSUES:
-because of px/frame, mouse sometimes overlaps wall
	-probably simply fix this separately each time it happens
-mouse can be swiped through wall
	-prevent by always checking if wall in front
-when mouse is in superposition, "weaker" embodiment will pass through wall
	-trying to fix through smarter GameCharacter object with a 
	better collider/collision method
